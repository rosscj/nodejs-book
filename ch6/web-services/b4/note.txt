It looks like node version 0.11 or greater is needed to run generators....
(but book what written using 0.10.20 so how do code examples work??)

Try using nvm to manage multiple versions of node - https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows

Old node version - 0.10.28
Upgrading to 0.11.16 works!

work computer old node version - 0.10.30
