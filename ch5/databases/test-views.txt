testing why view query returns no results

-- try posting new records with json structure that matches what I expect
	--> see if it's problem with rdf parsing ...
	
-- use post-book.js, change json everytime...
	--> response from view query is different ... 
		-- after adding record with two authors and two subjects: {rows: [{key: null, value: 2}] }
		-- after adding another record, 1 author, 3 subjects: {rows: [{key: null, value: 3}] }
			--> looks like something is wrong with view ...
			
		-- by_subject view returns {rows: [{key: null, value: 10}] }
		
		
	--> maybe trying transforming all records out there , removing everything but what's expected...
