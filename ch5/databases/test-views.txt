testing why view query returns no results

-- try posting new records with json structure that matches what I expect
	--> see if it's problem with rdf parsing ...
	
-- use post-book.js, change json everytime...
	--> response from view query is different ... 
		-- after adding record with two authors and two subjects: {rows: [{key: null, value: 2}] }
		-- after adding another record, 1 author, 3 subjects: {rows: [{key: null, value: 3}] }
			--> looks like something is wrong with view ...
			
		-- by_subject view returns {rows: [{key: null, value: 10}] }
		
		
	--> maybe trying transforming all records out there , removing everything but what's expected...
	
-->> something is wrong with dbcli.js ... it's not encoding values as json
	-- can see views in browser - http://127.0.0.1:5984/books/_design/books/_view/all_authors?key=%221%22
		-- this has key="1" encoded
		-- encoding values on command line works...
			-- running this on command line dbcli works - node --harmony GET books/_design/books/_view/all_authors?key=%221%22
	--> problem is windows strips double quotes off of command line

	--> other views (by_author, by_subject) look ok if data is structured correctly (ids 3-6 that I added manually)
		-- by_subject might be off, seemed doubled? 
		-- good enough to move on though
		
-- 2/14/15
	-- fixed rdf-parsing to make subjects and authers correct arrays (they were 'cheerio arrays' before)
	-- so need to remake books database
		-- run:
			node --harmony dbcli.js DELETE books
			node --harmony dblci.js PUT books
			node --harmony import-books.js
				-- will take a while, can check progress in different bash window with:
				node --harmony dbcli.js GET books -- doc_count property will be increasing
